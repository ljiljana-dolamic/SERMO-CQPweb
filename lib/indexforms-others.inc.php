			<p>CQPweb was created by Andrew Hardie (Lancaster University).</p>
				
			<p>Most of the architecture, the look-and-feel, and even some snippets of code
			were shamelessly half-inched from <em>BNCweb</em>.</p>
			
			<p>BNCweb's most recent version was written by Sebastian Hoffmann 
			(University of Trier) and Stefan Evert (FAU Erlangen-Nuremberg). 
			It was originally created by Hans-Martin Lehmann, 
			Sebastian Hoffmann, and Peter Schneider.</p>
			
			<p>The underlying technology of CQPweb is manifold.</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Concordancing is done using the
					<a target="_blank" href="http://cwb.sourceforge.net/">IMS Corpus Workbench</a>		
					with its
					<a target="_blank" href="http://www.cogsci.uni-osnabrueck.de/~korpora/ws/CWBdoc/CQP_Tutorial/">
						CQP corpus query processor</a>.
					Thus the name.
					<br/>&nbsp;
				</li>
				<li>Other functions (collocations, corpus management etc.) are powered by
					<a target="_blank" href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> databases.
					<br/>&nbsp;
				</li>
				<li>The system uses 
					<a target="_blank" href="http://www.cogsci.uni-osnabrueck.de/~severt/">
						Stefan Evert</a>'s
					Simple Query (CEQL) parser, which is written in
					<a target="_blank" href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a>.
					<br/>&nbsp;
				</li>
				<li>The web-scripts are written in 
					<a target="_blank" href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a>.
					<br/>&nbsp;
				</li>
				<li>Some 
					<a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3schools.com/JS/default.asp/">JavaScript</a>
					is used to create interactive links and forms.
					<br/>&nbsp;
				</li>
				<li>The look-and-feel relies on
					<a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp">
						Cascading Style Sheets</a>
					plus good old fashioned
					<a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/">HTML</a>.

		<li>
		<b>Version 3.0.1</b>, 2011-08-20<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
		Implemented a better system for sorting corpora into categories on the homepage.
		<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
		Fixed a fairly nasty bug that was blocking corpus indexing.
		<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
		Fixed an uninformative error message when textual restrictions are selected that no texts actually 
		match (zero-sized section of the corpus). The new error message explains the issue more clearly.
		<br/>&nbsp;</li>

		<li>
		<b>Version 3.0.0</b>, 2011-07-18<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
		New feature: custom postprocess plugins!
		<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
		Fixed some bugs in unused parts of the CQP interface.
		<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
		Added support for all ISO-8859 character sets.
		<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
		Version number bumped to 3.0.0 to match new CWB versioning rules, though CQPweb is in fact now
		compatible with the post-Unicode versions of CWB (3.2.0+).
		<br/>&nbsp;</li>

		<li>
		<b>Version 2.17</b>, 2011-05-18<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
		Fixed a fairly critical (and very silly) bug that was blocking compression of indexed corpora.
		<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
		Added extra significance-threshold options for keywords analysis.
		<br/>&nbsp;</li>

		<li>
		<b>Version 2.16</b>, 2011-03-08<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
		Added a workaround for a problem that arises with some MySQL security setups.
		<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
		Added an optional RSS feed of system messages, and made links in system messages display correctly
		both within webpages and in the RSS feed.
		<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
		Created a storage location for executable command-line scripts that perform offline administration
		tasks (in a stroke of unparalleled originality, I call it "bin").
		<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
		Added customisable headers and logos to the homepage (a default CWB logo is supplied).
		<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
		Fixed a bug in right-to-left corpora (Arabic etc.) where collocations were referred to as being "to
		the right" or "to the left" of the node even though this was wrong by about 180 degrees.
		<br/>&nbsp;</li>

		<li>
		<b>Version 2.15</b>, 2010-12-02<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
		Licence switched from GPLv3+ to GPLv2+ to match the rest of CWB. Some source files remain to be updated!
		<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
		A framework for "plugins" (semi-freestanding programlets) has been added. Three types of
		plugins are envisaged: transliterator plugins, annotator plugins, and format-checker plugins. Some
		"default" plugins will be supplied later.
		<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
		Some tweaks have been made to the concordance download options, in particular, giving a new default
		download style (&ldquo;field-data-style&rdquo;).
		<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
		For the adminstrator, there is a new group-access-cloning function.
		<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
		The required version of CWB has been dropped back down to a late v2, but you still need 3.2.x
		if you want UTF-8 regular expression matching to work properly in all languages.
		<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
		Improvements to query cache management internals.
		<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
		Plus the usual bug fixes, including some that deal with security issues, and further work on the R
		interface.
		<br/>&nbsp;</li>

		<li>
		<b>Version 2.14</b>, 2010-08-27<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
		Quite a few new features this time. First, finer control over concordance display has been added;
		if you have the data, you can how have concordance results rendered as three-line-examples (field
		data or typology style with interlinear glosses).
		<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
		The R interface is ready for use with this version, although it is not actually used anywhere yet, and
		additional interface methods will be added as the need for them becomes evident. It goes without saying 
		that you need R installed in order to do anything with this.
		<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
		The new Web API has been established, and the first two functions "query" and "concordance" created.
		Documentation for the Web API is still on the to-do list, and it's not quite ready for use...
		<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
		Plus, a new function for creating snapshots of the system (useful for making backups); a "diagnostic"
		interface for checking out common problems in setting up CQP (incomplete as yet); and some improvements
		to the documentation for system administrators.
		<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
		Also added a new subcorpus creation function which makes one subcorpus for every text in the corpus.
		<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
		
		<li>
		<b>Version 2.13</b>, 2010-05-31<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
		Increased required version of CWB to 3.2.0 (which has Unicode regular expression matching). This means
		that regular expression wildcards will work properly with non-Latin alphabets.
		<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
		Also added a function to create an "inverted" subcorpus (one that contains all the texts in the corpus
		except those in a specified existing subcorpus).
		<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
		Plus, as ever, more bug fixes and usability tweaks.
		<br/>&nbsp;</li>
		
		<li>
		<b>Version 2.12</b>, 2010-03-19<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
		Added first version of XML visualisation.
		<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
		Also made distribution tables sortable on frequency or category handle (latter remains the default). 
		<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
		Also added support for CQP macros and for configurable context
		width in concordances (including xml-based context width as well as word-based context width).
		<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
		Plus many bug fixes and minor tweaks.
		<br/>&nbsp;</li>
		
		<li>
		<b>Version 2.11</b>, 2010-01-20<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
		First release of 2010! CQPweb is now two years old.
		<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
		Added improved group access management, and a setting allowing corpora to be processed 
		in a case-sensitive way throughout (not recommended in general, but potentially useful 
		for some languages e.g. German).
		<br/> 
		Also added a big red warning that pops up when a user types an invalid character in a 
		"letters-and-numbers-only" entry on a form.
		<br/>
		Plus lots of bug fixes.
		<br/>&nbsp;</li>
		
		<li>
		<b>Version 2.10</b>, 2009-12-18<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
		Added customisable mapping tables for use with CEQL tertiary-annotations.
		<br/>&nbsp;</li>
		
		<li>
		<b>Version 2.09</b>, 2009-12-13<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
		New metadata-importing functions and other improvements to the internals of CQPweb.
		<br/>&nbsp;</li>
		
		<li>
		<b>Version 2.08</b>, 2009-11-27<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
		Updated internal database-query interaction. As a result, CQPweb requires CWB version 2.2.101 or later.
		<br/>
		Other changes (mostly behind-the-scenes):  enabled Latin-1 corpora; accelerated concordance display 
		by caching number of texts in a query in the database; plus assorted bug fixes.
		<br/>&nbsp;</li>
		
		<li>
		<b>Version 2.07</b>, 2009-09-08<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
		Fixed a bug in context display affecting untagged corpora.
		<br/>&nbsp;</li>
		
		<li>
		<b>Version 2.07</b>, 2009-08-07<br/>&nbsp;<br/>

			<h3>Found a bug?</h3>
			
			<p>If you observe a problem in the CQPweb software itself, you can report it to the CWB/CQPweb developers in two ways:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>
					Join <a href="http://devel.sslmit.unibo.it/mailman/listinfo/cwb">the CWB developers' email list</a> 
					and send an email to the list reporting your problem.
				</li>
				<li>
					If you have a SourceForge.net account, you can post a report to 
					<a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/cwb/bugs">our bug tracker</a>.
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>
				(Because of increasing levels of spam, we cannot accept anonymous bug reports either on the tracker or the email list.
				You must have an account.)
			</p>
			
			<p>Personal emails to the developers regarding bugs are accepted but we prefer to receive reports by the two public methods above.</p>
